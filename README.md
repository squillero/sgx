The *Selfish Gene* optimization algorithm (SG) is a population-less evolutionary algorithm loosely inspired by the interpretation of the Darwinian theory given by the English biologist Richard Dawkins and popularized as the *Selfish Gene theory*. It enables a user to efficiently find the list parameters, either discrete symbols or real numbers, that maximizes a given target function. [**[MORE]**](history.md)
