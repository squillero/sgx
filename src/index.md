The *Selfish Gene Algorithm* is a population-less evolutionary optimizer loosely inspired by the dashing interpretation of the Darwinian theory of Richard Dawkins popularized in the scientific blockbuster [*The Selfish Gene*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene). The optimization algorithm enables a user to efficiently find the list parameters, either discrete symbols or real numbers, that maximizes a given target function.

Over the years, the algorithm was [exploited](https://goo.gl/Baw9I8) by different researchers, and a few brand new approaches derived from it. To celebrate hitting the quarter century mark, the *Extended Selfish Gene* (SGX) is a brand new implementation of the idea, rewritten from scratch in Python 3, with improved usability, new features, and eventually including real-valued parameters.
