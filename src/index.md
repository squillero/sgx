The *Selfish Gene* optimization algorithm (SG) is a population-less evolutionary algorithm loosely inspired by the interpretation of the Darwinian theory given by the English biologist Richard Dawkins and popularized as the *Selfish Gene theory*. It enables a user to efficiently find the list parameters, either discrete symbols or real numbers, that maximizes a given target function.

Over the years, the algorithm was [reimplemented](https://goo.gl/Baw9I8) by different researchers in different languages, and a few brand new approaches derived from it. To celebrate hitting the quarter century mark, the *Extended Selfish Gene* (SGX) is a brand new implementation of the idea, rewritten from scratch in Python 3, with improved usability and several new features, and eventually including real-valued parameters.
